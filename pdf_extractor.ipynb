EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH, Vol. 48(2) 199-221, 2013\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING: AN APPROACH FOR\\nDEVELOPING TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL\\nCONTENT KNOWLEDGE\\nCHAROULA ANGELI\\nNICOS VALANIDES\\nUniversity of Cyprus\\nABSTRACT\\nTechnology mapping ™ is proposed as an approach for developing tech-\\nnological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK). The study discusses in\\ndetail instructional design guidelines in relation to the enactment of TM,\\nand reports on empirical findings from a study with 72 pre-service primary\\nteachers within the context of teaching them how to teach with Excel.\\nRepeated Measures MANOVA findings showed that TM was effective\\nand efficient in developing TPCK competencies; however, development\\nof TPCK competencies was directly related to the complexity of the design\\ntask, as this was determined by the educational affordances of Excel.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nTechnological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) was introduced to\\nthe educational research community as a theoretical framework of what teachers\\nneed to know to teach with technology (Angeli & Valanides, 2005; Koehler\\n& Mishra, 2005; Niess, 2005; Pierson, 2001). The research community\\nembraced with enthusiasm the framework and a substantial body of research has\\nbeen published (Voogt, Fisser, Pareja Roblin, Tondeur, & van Braak, 2013).\\nNonetheless, a number of issues remain unresolved, and, therefore, any new\\n199\\n� 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.\\ndoi: http://dx.doi.org/10.2190/EC.48.2.e\\nhttp://baywood.com\\n200\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\nresearch efforts that are undertaken to advance the theoretical conceptualization\\nof TPCK, or report data on methods of how to develop and assess TPCK, are\\nfully warranted.\\nThe authors herein revisit some of the theoretical issues about the nature of\\nTPCK that are still debated in the literature, clarify which theoretical stance\\nabout TPCK the present study adopts, and discuss technology mapping as a\\nmethod for developing TPCK. The study also reports on empirical evidence\\nregarding the effectiveness of technology mapping within the context of teaching\\npre-service primary teachers how to teach with Excel.\\nCURRENT THEORETICAL CONCEPTIONS\\nOF TPCK\\nIn the literature, there are two dominant theoretical models about the con-\\nceptualization of TPCK—the integrative model and the transformative model.\\nThe integrative model, as shown in Figure 1, was proposed by Koehler and\\nMishra (2005), and it conceptualizes TPCK as an integrative body of knowledge\\ndefined by the intersections between content and pedagogy, content and tech-\\nnology, and pedagogy and technology. The transformative model, shown in\\nFigure 1. Graphical representation of TPCK\\n(adopted from Mishra & Koehler, 2006).\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n201\\nFigure 2. Graphical representation of TPCK as a\\ntransformative body of knowledge.\\nFigure 2, was proposed by Angeli and Valanides (2005), and it conceptualizes\\nTPCK as a unique body of knowledge. In the transformative model, content,\\npedagogy, learners, technology, and context are regarded as significant con-\\ntributors to the development of TPCK.\\nBoth models view TPCK as an extension of Shulman’s (1986, 1987) peda-\\ngogical content knowledge (PCK). PCK identifies the distinctive bodies of knowl-\\nedge for teaching, and highlights a special amalgam of content, pedagogy,\\nlearners, and context (Shulman, 1986). Shulman’s (1987) conceptualization of\\nPCK goes beyond teachers’ knowledge of subject matter and pedagogy per se,\\nand encompasses the dimension of how to teach and transform content into\\nforms or representations comprehensible to learners, taking always into con-\\nsideration learners’ content-related difficulties. Despite having PCK as their\\ncommon theoretical basis, the two models are based on different epistemological\\nstances regarding the nature of TPCK.\\nMishra and Koehler (2006) used the general term TPCK to include all\\nforms of digital technologies (i.e., internet, digital video), as well as standard\\n202\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\ntechnologies (i.e., books, chalk, and blackboard), whereas Angeli and Valanides\\n(2005) used the term ICT-TPCK to put emphasis on the fact that the T\\nin TPCK referred to computer-based technologies only. In 2007, Mishra\\nand Koehler’s TPCK changed to TPACK, which was proposed as a term\\nthat could be more easily spoken and remembered (Thompson & Mishra,\\n2007). TPACK emphasizes through its letters in the acronym the three\\nkinds of knowledge, namely, content, pedagogy, and technology, which\\nare deemed important for successfully integrating technology in teaching\\nand learning. Additionally, according to Thompson and Mishra, TPACK\\n“captures the fact that these three knowledge domains should not be taken\\nin isolation, but rather that they form an integrated whole, a ‘Total PACKage’”\\n(p. 38). Despite the fact that after 2007 the acronym TPACK has been used\\nconsiderably in the literature, it has not been widely adopted by everyone\\n(Voogt et al., 2013).\\nTPACK, as depicted in Figure 1, is represented in terms of three inter-\\nsecting circles, one for each distinct knowledge base, namely, content, peda-\\ngogy, and technology (Mishra & Koehler, 2006), while its subcomponents,\\ni.e.,\\ntechnological\\ncontent\\nknowledge\\n(TCK),\\ntechnological\\npedagogical\\nknowledge (TPK), and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), are also\\nclearly depicted in the figure. Angeli and Valanides (2009) argued that it\\nwas not clear from the initial work of Mishra and Koehler whether TPCK\\nwas conceptualized as an integrative or distinct form of knowledge. Later,\\nempirical work by Mishra and Koehler and other researchers who adopted\\nTPACK (e.g., Chai, Kho, Tsai, & Tan, 2011; Harris & Hofer, 2011;\\nSchmidt, Baran, Thompson, Mishra, Koehler, & Shin, 2009) clearly showed\\nthat the interest was on identifying and measuring instances of TPACK’s\\nsubcomponents, for example, TPK and TCK. So far, empirical findings from\\nthis line of research have been rather discouraging, because it has proven\\ntoo difficult to define the boundaries of the different TPACK sub-components\\n(Angeli & Valanides, 2009; Archambault & Crippen, 2009; Graham, 2011;\\nVoogt et al., 2013).\\nICT-TPCK (TPCK from now on) as shown in Figure 2, is conceptualized\\nin terms of five distinct knowledge bases, namely, content knowledge,\\npedagogical knowledge, knowledge of learners, knowledge of educational\\ncontext, and ICT knowledge (Angeli & Valanides, 2005, 2009). Based on\\nthe results of empirical investigations, Valanides and Angeli (2008a, 2008b)\\nconcluded that TPCK is a distinct body of knowledge that goes beyond\\nmere\\nintegration\\nor\\naccumulation\\nof\\nthe\\nconstituent\\nknowledge\\nbases,\\ntoward transformation of these contributing knowledge bases into something\\nnew and unique. For this reason, the authors have not adopted the new\\nterm TPACK and opted to continue using TPCK instead, because TPACK\\nappears to be more associated with the integrative view rather than the trans-\\nformative view.\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n203\\nTPCK AS A TRANSFORMATIVE BODY\\nOF KNOWLEDGE\\nTPCK as a transformative body of knowledge is defined as knowledge about\\nhow to transform content and pedagogy with ICT for specific learners in specific\\ncontexts and in ways that signify the added value of ICT (Angeli & Valanides,\\n2009). As illustrated in Figure 2, there are a number of individual knowledge\\nbases that contribute to the development of TPCK; however, as was found in a\\nseries of empirical studies, growth in the individual contributing knowledge\\nbases alone, without specific instruction exclusively targeting the development\\nof TPCK, does not result in TPCK growth (Angeli, 2005; Angeli & Valanides,\\n2005; Valanides & Angeli, 2006, 2008a, 2008b). Therefore, research efforts\\nfocusing on the development of TPCK as a unique type of knowledge are essential\\nfor advancing the field.\\nAngeli and Valanides (2009) also proposed that TPCK, as a unique body of\\nknowledge, is better understood in terms of competencies that teachers need to\\ndevelop in order to be able to teach with technology adequately. A conceptual-\\nization of TPCK in terms of competencies has led to more robust and reliable\\nways of assessing learners’ TPCK, bypassing measurement difficulties of the\\nnature that researchers who adopted the TPACK framework reported in their\\nstudies (Archambault & Barnett, 2010; Cox & Graham, 2009; Graham, 2011;\\nNiess, 2011). These competencies are related to knowing how to:\\n1. Identify topics to be taught with ICT in ways that signify the added value\\nof ICT tools, such as topics that students cannot easily comprehend or that\\nteachers face difficulties teaching or presenting effectively in class. These\\ntopics may include abstract concepts (i.e., cells, molecules) that need to\\nbe visualized, phenomena from the physical and social sciences that need\\nto be animated (i.e., water cycle, the law of supply and demand), complex\\nsystems (i.e., ecosystems, organizations) in which certain factors function\\nsystemically and need to be simulated or modeled, and topics that require\\nmultimodal transformations (i.e., textual, iconic, and auditory), such as\\nphonics and language learning.\\n2. Identify appropriate representations for transforming the content to be\\ntaught into forms that are pedagogically powerful and difficult to support\\nby traditional means. These include interactive representations, dynamic\\ntransformation of data, dynamic processing of data, multiple simultaneous\\nrepresentations of data, and multimodal representations of data.\\n3. Identify teaching tactics, which are difficult or impossible to implement by\\nother means, such as the application of ideas in contexts that are not\\nexperienced in real life. For example, exploration and discovery in virtual\\nworlds, virtual visits (i.e., virtual museums), testing of hypotheses, simu-\\nlations, complex decision-making, modeling, long distance communi-\\ncation and collaboration with experts, long distance communication and\\n204\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\ncollaboration with peers, personalized learning, adaptive learning, and\\ncontext-sensitive feedback.\\n4. Select tools with appropriate affordances to support 2 and 3 above.\\n5. Infuse computer activities with appropriate learner-centered strategies in\\nthe classroom. This includes any strategy that puts the learner at the center\\nof the learning process to express a point of view, observe, explore, inquire,\\nthink, reflect, discover, problem solve, etc.\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING:\\nAN APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING TPCK\\nTechnology Mapping ™, shown in Figure 3, was first introduced as an\\napproach for developing teachers’ TPCK in 2009 (Angeli & Valanides, 2009).\\nTM was proposed as an approach for mapping tool affordances onto content\\nand pedagogy in powerful and transformative ways, enabling teachers to develop\\ncomplex and interrelated ideas between the affordances of technology and\\ntheir pedagogical content knowledge. Angeli and Valanides argued that TM can\\nengage learners in a process of developing technological solutions to pedagogical\\nproblems by aligning teachers’ PCK with knowledge about the affordances and\\nconstraints of various computer-based technologies. Mapping refers to the process\\nof establishing connections or linkages among the affordances of a tool, content,\\nand pedagogy in relation to learners’ content-related difficulties.\\nTM is a dynamic, situated, and personal design process because teachers’\\ninstructional design decisions are guided by a body of knowledge that is highly\\nsituated in the context of their real classroom experiences (Carter, 1990; Kagan &\\nTippins, 1992; Leinhardt, 1988; Moallem, 1998). As shown in Figure 3, context is\\nan overarching factor in the process of designing learning with technology. The\\nprocess of designing technology-enhanced learning is influenced by certain\\ncontext-related factors, such as teachers’ beliefs about how students learn,\\nteachers’ practical experiences about what can and what cannot work in a real\\nclassroom, teachers’ views about the role of technology in teaching and learning,\\nteachers’ adopted instructional practices, school’s vision, and educational goals.\\nThese context-related factors influence teachers’ thinking about how technology\\nis integrated in the classroom (Abbitt, 2011; Niess, 2005; Ottenbreit-Leftwich,\\nGlazewski, Newby, & Ertmer, 2010). For example, if a teacher has deep-rooted\\nbeliefs in teacher-centered learning, then technology integration will most likely\\nbe teacher-directed (i.e., the teacher uses the technology to deliver information to\\nstudents) and not learner-directed (i.e., the students use the technology as a\\ncognitive tool to construct/represent meaning about something). Context is\\nincluded in the model to promote reflection about the ways context-related factors\\nmay impact teachers’ designs of technology-enhanced learning. Furthermore, TM\\nallows teachers to bring experiences from their classrooms into the design process,\\nand, specifically, experiences that are related to teachers’ PCK, that is, teachers’\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n205\\nFigure 3. Technology mapping (adopted from\\nAngeli & Valanides, 2009).\\n206\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\nunderstandings of their students’ alternative conceptions and learning difficulties\\nin relation to certain curriculum topics, as well as teachers’ understandings of\\ntheir own difficulties in making a specific content teachable and easily learnable\\nfor their students.\\nAccording to the model depicted in Figure 3, teacher educators ask pre-service\\nor in-service teachers to think about a specific content domain, and, based on\\ntheir experiences, to indicate their difficulties in making the most challenging\\naspects of the domain teachable to students, in connection with students’ content-\\nrelated difficulties. Subsequently, for each topic, teachers associate relevant\\ncontent (represented as circles in Figure 3) and tentative objectives based on\\nlearners’ related alternative conceptions that need to be addressed. Then teachers\\nare engaged in iterative decision making in order to think how to go about\\ntransforming the content with technology into representations that are more\\nunderstandable to learners. In doing so, teachers need to first decide how\\ntools can be used to transform the content into powerful representations (upper\\npart of the diamond), how to tailor these representations for the specific needs\\nof their students, and how to use technology in innovative ways to transform\\nexisting pedagogical practices in their respective classrooms (lower part of\\nthe diamond).\\nNonetheless, the authors of the present study recognize that currently in the\\nliterature the underlying instructional design processes of TM, encapsulated in\\nthe diamond shape in Figure 3, are not explicitly discussed and exemplified.\\nTherefore, the authors aim with the contribution herein to provide teacher edu-\\ncators with specific guidance and examples about how to enact TM.\\nFROM TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS TO\\nEDUCATIONAL AFFORDANCES\\nAffordances are properties of the relationship between an agent and its physical\\nenvironment. These properties allow and facilitate specific types of interaction.\\nGibson (1977, 1979) defined affordances as all action possibilities latent in\\nthe environment, objectively measurable and independent of the individual’s\\nexperience, knowledge, culture, or ability to recognize them. Norman’s (1988,\\n1990) conceptualization of affordances diverges from Gibson’s conceptualization\\nin that Norman defines an affordance as something of both actual and perceived\\nproperties. When actual and perceived properties are combined, an affordance\\nemerges as a relationship that holds between the object and the individual that\\nis acting on the object (Norman, 1990).\\nFrom the literature on teachers’ understandings of technology affordances,\\nit is evident that: (a) teachers do not distinguish between the technical functions\\nof technology and the educational affordances of technology (Angeli, 2013;\\nAngeli & Valanides, 2005; Valanides & Angeli, 2008b); (b) teachers are not\\nalways aware of the cognitive processes involved in using the affordances of a\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n207\\nparticular technology (Yoon, Ho, & Hedberg, 2005); and (c) teachers’ formation\\nof mental models of technology affordances largely depends upon their training\\nand their professional development (Angeli, 2013; Krauskopf, Zahn, & Hesse,\\n2012). Based on these findings, going from knowing how to use a tool to knowing\\nhow to teach with a tool, or going from knowing about the technical functions of\\ntechnology to perceiving the educational affordances of technology, does not\\noccur automatically. Therefore, it becomes imperative that teacher educators\\nmake this process explicit during teacher training.\\nTeaching pre-service or in-service teachers how to teach with technology\\ninvolves more than just making the educational affordances of technology\\nexplicit to them. For example, a course on teaching teachers how to teach with a\\ntool also involves, among other things, teaching the tool itself. In such cases,\\ntypically, teacher educators first teach students how to use the tool, and then they\\nillustrate through various examples how the tool can be integrated in classroom\\nteaching. The time devoted to teaching the tools themselves is usually more\\nthan the time left to teach students how to teach with the tools. This approach\\nis for the most part fragmented and decontextualized, because the majority of\\nthe time is devoted to demonstrating, one by one, the technical functions\\nof the tools, and not on illustrating the educational affordances of the tools\\nin relation to content and pedagogy within the context of a design task. Addi-\\ntionally, an approach that focuses on teaching one at a time the technical\\nfunctions of technology prevents learners from developing adequate and\\nholistic mental models about the affordances of technology, and the connec-\\ntions among technology, content, pedagogy, and learners. The idea that learners\\nwill develop these mental models by themselves can only be characterized as\\nwishful thinking.\\nTechnology mapping is about making the educational affordances of the\\ntools explicit within the context of an authentic design task, while, at the same\\ntime, students also learn how to use the technology itself. In particular, the authors\\ndeveloped the following seven instructional design guidelines to facilitate the\\nenactment of the TM process. These guidelines are intended to be used by\\nteacher educators or teacher trainers after selecting appropriate topics and\\ncontent to be taught with technology. The guidelines are provided as an expan-\\nsion or elaboration of the diamond shape in Figure 3, and they are proposed\\nas a way to help teachers construct mental models of technology affordances\\nwithin the context of an authentic design task directly related to the curriculum.\\nThey include:\\n1. Discuss, in a sequence from simple to complex, the educational affordances\\nof a tool for the specific target group of students.\\n2. Demonstrate each educational affordance, with a worked-out design task,\\nusing a series of technical functions within the context of an appropriate\\nreal curriculum topic.\\n208\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\n3. Discuss and explain the structure of the worked-out design task in terms\\nof its underlying instructional design (i.e., objectives, design of an instruc-\\ntional sequence of activities, etc.).\\n4. Let students practice with the affordance using a new design task, and by\\nintroducing gradually more and more technical functions, as needed.\\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 as many times as instructional/classroom time allows\\naccording to one’s discretion, moving gradually from worked-out design\\ntasks to semi-completed design tasks, to new design tasks.\\n6. Continue with a new educational affordance and repeat steps 2 to 5 until all\\neducational affordances are discussed, illustrated, and practiced.\\n7. Select a new tool, and repeat steps 1 to 6.\\nThe authors maintain that the TM guidelines promote a spiral approach to\\nlearning how to use a computer tool. The spiral approach is a method where first\\nthe basic facts of a subject are learned, and gradually as learning progresses,\\nmore and more details are introduced while, at the same time, the basics are\\nrevisited (Bruner, 1960; Duncan & Hmelo-Silver, 2009). Respectively, the TM\\nguidelines promote teaching the basic functions of a tool first, followed by the\\nmore complex. It is not the aim of TM to exhaustively teach all technical functions\\nof a tool in one particular course.\\nIn general, the TM guidelines reflect a holistic approach to developing all\\ncompetencies teachers need to teach with technology. A holistic design\\napproach is successful in preventing compartmentalization and fragmenta-\\ntion (van Merrienboer & Kirschner, 2007). Compartmentalization refers to the\\nseparation of a whole into distinct parts. This approach leads to a piecemeal\\napproach of aquiring knowledge, seriously limiting one’s ability to develop an\\nintegrated body of knowledge which includes skills, facts, procedures, principles,\\nattitudes, beliefs, and dispositions. Fragmentation is the process of breaking\\nsomething into small or isolated parts (van Merrienboer, Clark, & de Croock,\\n2002). The implications of such an approach is that learning objectives are taught\\nin isolation, one at a time, and not in coordination with each other, leading to a\\nhighly fragmented body of knowledge.\\nIn particular, the TM guidelines represent an instructional design model that\\nis rooted in van Merrienboers’ four-component instructional design theory\\n(van Merrienboer, 1997) which can be described as consisting of learning tasks,\\nsupportive information, procedural information, and part-task practice. Learning\\ntasks are in this case design tasks that aim at integrating design skills, knowl-\\nedge of content, pedagogy, technology, and learners, and beliefs about the role\\nof technology in teaching and learning. These design tasks are organized in\\neasy-to-difficult task classes and have diminishing support in each task class.\\nThis is realized by presenting students with design tasks ranging from worked-out\\ndesign tasks to semi-completed design tasks and to new design tasks. Sup-\\nportive information is specified for each design-task class and is related to the\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n209\\ninstructional design of each task contingent upon a particular technology afford-\\nance. Then, for the routine aspects of each design task, procedural information is\\nprovided when needed, to specify exactly how to perform the routine aspects of\\nthe task. Part-task (practice) items are provided to help learners reach a high level\\nof automaticity for selected routine aspects of a design task, such as, for example,\\npracticing a set of technology functions pertinent to a particular design task.\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nParticipants\\nSeventy-two juniors from a teacher education department participated in the\\nstudy. At the time, students were enrolled in three sections of an instructional\\ntechnology course to learn how to design and develop learning activities\\nwith Excel appropriate for young learners. The duration of the course was\\n13 weeks. Each section met once a week in a computer laboratory for 2.5\\nhours. The challenge in teaching the course was threefold, as students needed\\nto learn: (a) how to use the technical functions of Excel; (b) about the educa-\\ntional affordances of Excel; and (c) how to design technology-enhanced learning\\nactivities with Excel for young learners.\\nAssessment Tasks\\nStudents’ TPCK was assessed based on their performance on five design tasks,\\none for each of the five educational affordances of Excel that were discussed in the\\ncourse during the semester. The time allotted for completing and submitting a\\ndesign task for grading was 2 weeks. Students completed their first design task\\nin the 3rd week of the course, and their fifth design task in the 11th week of\\nthe course. Pre-service teachers were specifically instructed to submit, along with\\na CD with their Excel activities, a five-page word document for each design\\ntask addressing the following elements:\\n1. description of a topic to be taught with Excel in ways that exploit the added\\nvalue of Excel;\\n2. identification of appropriate Excel representations for transforming the\\ncontent to be taught into forms that are comprehensible to learners and\\ndifficult to support by traditional means;\\n3. identification of teaching strategies with Excel, which are difficult or impos-\\nsible to implement by traditional means;\\n4. design of appropriate computer-based learning activities that exemplify\\nadequately the educational affordances of Excel; and\\n5. infusion of the Excel activities in a classroom lesson with learner-centered\\nstrategies.\\n210\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\nParticipants’ design tasks constituted the unit of analysis. Performance on\\neach design task was assessed using the evaluation criteria for TPCK com-\\npetencies shown in Table 1, and the evaluation criteria for each educational\\naffordance of Excel shown analytically in Table 2. The maximum score for\\neach design element was 20, thus the highest assessment score possible for each\\ndesign task was 100. Two raters, one of the researchers and a doctoral candidate\\nin instructional technology who was also the teaching assistant for the course,\\nrated students’ performance on the five design tasks. The inter-rater reliability\\nwas found to be .91, .88, .85, .87, and .84, for the first, second, third, fourth,\\nand fifth design tasks, respectively. Observed disagreements were resolved con-\\nstructively after discussion.\\nResearch Procedures\\nThe course instructor, who was the same for all three sections, first discussed\\nin class the philosophy behind teaching with technology. The departure from\\ntechnologies as media for transferring facts and information to technologies as\\ncognitive tools for constructing meaning and representing understanding was\\nemphasized. Then, students were asked to think about topics that traditionally\\nwere regarded as difficult to understand or teach. Students were able to recall\\nfrom their other teacher education courses and identified a number of suitable\\ntopics. Then, the course instructor introduced Excel as a tool with certain edu-\\ncational affordances for teaching and learning. Specifically, the course instructor\\ndiscussed five distinct educational affordances of Excel in a sequence from\\nsimple to complex, as follows: (a) Excel as a tool for organizing information;\\n(b) Excel as a tool for giving feedback; (c) Excel as a tool for creating a hypertext\\nstory; (d) Excel as a tool for performing calculations; and (e) Excel as a modeling\\ntool. Then, for each educational affordance, the course instructor, with the help\\nof the participants, chose curriculum topics and determined content suitable to\\nbe taught with Excel. For example, to illustrate the use of Excel as a modeling\\ntool, the course instructor demonstrated how Excel could be used to model\\nthe phenomenon of the growth of plants, and the water cycle. Subsequently, the\\ncourse instructor demonstrated each educational affordance with the application\\nof a series of technical functions within the context of a simple real curriculum\\nexample. Students were allowed to practice the same affordance with a new design\\ntask, while new technical functions were also introduced accordingly as needed.\\nThis process continued with providing more examples of design tasks, albeit\\nof diminishing support, until a new affordance was introduced.\\nRESULTS\\nTable 3 shows descriptive statistics of pre-service teachers’ performance on\\nthe five design tasks for each TPCK competency. The first design task was about\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n211\\nutilizing Excel as a tool for organizing data, the second about utilizing Excel as a\\ntool for giving feedback, the third about Excel as a tool for creating a hypertext\\nstory, the fourth about Excel as a tool for performing calculations, and the fifth\\nwas about Excel as a modeling tool. Each design task was progressively more\\ncomplex than the previous one(s), in terms of the underlying instructional design\\nof the learning activities with Excel relative to the five affordances.\\nAs the results show in Table 3, students’ performance on the first design task\\nwas consistently high across all five TPCK competencies. Students’ performance\\non the second design task was high for the first two competencies and relatively\\nhigh for the last three competencies. Students’ performance on the remaining three\\ndesign tasks was much lower than students’ performance on the first two design\\ntasks. In fact, students’ performance after the second design task progressively\\ndropped, so that students’ scores on the third design task for each TPCK com-\\npetency were much lower than students’ scores on the second design task.\\nSimilarly, students’ scores on the fourth design task were much lower than\\nstudents’ scores on the third design task, and students’ scores on the fifth design\\ntask were much lower than students’ scores on the fourth design task. Obviously,\\nas the findings showed, thinking about how to use Excel to model a phenomenon\\nhad inherently a higher degree of difficulty compared to using the tool as a means\\nfor organizing information, or providing feedback, or creating a hypertext story,\\nimplying that more time and effort should be devoted to teaching students about\\nmodeling and how Excel can be used as a modeling tool.\\nRepeated Measures MANOVA was performed to identify differences in TPCK\\ncompetencies across the five design tasks. The results showed statistically sig-\\nnificant differences for all five TPCK competencies across all five design tasks\\nas follows: (a) identification of topics to be taught with Excel, F(4, 67) = 16.84,\\np < 0.01, partial �2 = .16; (b) identification of representations for transforming the\\ncontent into appropriate forms, F(4, 67) = 15.87, p < 0.01, partial �2 = .15;\\n(c) identification of teaching strategies, which are difficult or impossible to be\\nimplemented by traditional means, F(4, 67) = 16.36, p < 0.01, partial �2 = .14;\\n(d) pedagogical utilization of the affordances of Excel, F(4, 67) = 13.98, p < 0.01,\\npartial �2 = .14; and (e) identification of learner-centered strategies for the\\ninfusion of Excel in the classroom, F(4, 67) = 15.10, p < 0.01, partial �2 = .15.\\nPost hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD method showed significant dif-\\nferences regarding students’ scores on the first TPCK competency between: (a) the\\nfirst design task and the third, fourth, and fifth design tasks; and (b) the second\\ndesign task and the third, fourth, and fifth design tasks as well. No significant\\ndifferences were detected between the first and second tasks regarding the first\\nTPCK competency. Regarding the second TPCK competency, significant dif-\\nferences were found between: (a) the first design task and the third, fourth, and\\nfifth design tasks; (b) the second design task and the fourth and fifth design tasks;\\nand (c) the third and fifth design tasks. Similarly, concerning the third TPCK\\ncompetency, significant differences were found between: (a) the first design task\\n212\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\n1.

Regarding the\\nfourth TPCK competency, significant differences were found between: (a) the first\\ndesign task and the fourth and fifth design tasks; (b) the second design task and the\\nfifth design task; (c) the third and fifth design tasks; and (d) the fourth and fifth\\ndesign tasks. Lastly, regarding the fifth TPCK competency, significant differences\\nwere found between: (a) the first design task and the third, fourth, and fifth design\\ntasks; (b) the second design task and the fourth and fifth design tasks; (c) the third\\nand fifth design tasks; and (d) the fourth and fifth design tasks.\\nStudents were also asked to comment on their design experiences with Excel.\\nAll students said that their experiences, prior to taking this course, with learning\\nhow to use a computer program were limited to learning how to use the tool in a\\ndecontextualized way with a focus on learning to use the technical functions of\\nthe tool only. Such an approach, students added, was very limiting, because it did\\nnot demonstrate the educational affordances of the tool in teaching and learning a\\nparticular subject matter. In addition, the majority of the participants stated that\\na teacher may know how to use a tool, but he or she may not know how to utilize\\nthe tool pedagogically in the classroom in ways that exploit the distinct edu-\\ncational affordances of the tool. As a consequence, students strongly pointed out\\nthat the educational affordances of a tool must always be made explicit by teacher\\neducators, because often times teachers’ ignorance about the educational afford-\\nances may lead to the misuse of the tool in the classroom. When students were\\nasked to self-evaluate their TPCK, all of them stated that the course added to the\\ndevelopment of their TPCK, because they now had a better understanding about\\nhow to use Excel to transform content into powerful representations. This was\\nmore evident in the case about utilizing Excel as a modeling tool, because, as\\nstudents mentioned, they had to think hard about a topic that was appropriate for\\nyoung learners to understand and at the same time complex enough to be taught\\nwith models. Students also mentioned that they no longer struggled over the\\nselection of an appropriate topic to be taught with technology, but rather to under-\\nstand in creative ways the educational affordances of a computer tool, and to map\\ntool affordances onto content and pedagogy. In asking the students to suggest\\nways of how their TPCK could be further developed, all students expressed the\\nneed to be explicitly taught about the educational affordances of tools in their\\nremaining teacher education courses, as well as to practice identifying the educa-\\ntional affordances of tools within the context of authentic design tasks across\\ntheir undergraduate curriculum.\\nDISCUSSION\\nTeaching how to teach with technology is a complex task, because on the one\\nhand teacher educators need to teach the tool, and on the other hand, they need\\nto teach how to design learning activities with the tool. In this article, TM was\\n218\\n/\\nANGELI AND VALANIDES\\nproposed as a holistic approach for developing TPCK competencies, so that\\nknowledge about the affordances of tools, content, pedagogy, and learners is\\nused concurrently in an iterative instructional design process. Based on the\\nfindings of the study, TPCK can be developed as a unique body of knowledge in\\npowerful learning environments where technology teaching is situated in real\\nand authentic design tasks, and in ways that teacher educators explicitly teach\\nabout the educational affordances of tools.\\nAccording to the data presented in Table 3 and the results of the repeated\\nmeasures MANOVA, students’ development of TPCK competencies was directly\\nrelated to the complexity of the task, as this was determined by the educational\\naffordances of Excel. For example, the task related to the design of activities for\\nutilizing Excel as a tool for organizing data or as a tool for providing feedback\\nwas simpler than the task related to the design of activities for utilizing Excel\\nas a tool for creating a hypertext story, or performing calculations, or modeling\\na phenomenon. In fact, the task related to the design of activities for utilizing Excel\\nas a modeling tool had a higher degree of difficulty than all other affordances of\\nExcel. While the average performance on the third, fourth, and fifth design tasks\\nfor each TPCK competency together with the corresponding standard deviation\\nindicated that there was still space for improvement, albeit in different variations,\\nstudents’ development of all TPCK competencies across all five design tasks\\nover the duration of a 13-week course was more than satisfactory. These results\\nindicate that TM is both an efficient and effective approach for the development\\nof TPCK. Additionally, TM proved to be an economical approach as students\\nconcurrently developed technical skills and pedagogical skills regarding the edu-\\ncational uses of Excel in teaching in learning.\\nBased on the participants’ qualitative comments, teacher education courses\\nmust invest time and effort in helping students develop their TPCK competencies,\\nso that students are able to perceive their courses as a connected whole such that\\nthe development of integrated mental models about what to teach, how to teach,\\nfor whom, by what means, and under what conditions is effectively and efficiently\\nfacilitated. Accordingly, the results of the study showed that TM was also effective\\nin terms of organizing fragmented pieces of knowledge into meaningful wholes.\\nAdditionally, the instructional design guidelines about how to teach Excel can\\nbe applied to teaching other computer applications as well; thus, this study may\\ninform ongoing debates in informatics education about how computer applications\\ncan be taught in contextualized ways across the disciplines (ACM K–12 Task\\nForce Curriculum Committee, 2003). In particular, teachers who teach informatics\\nconstitute a special group of teachers, because they are technology experts by\\ntraining, and technology is what they teach. However, their expertise oftentimes\\nis limited to the mere technical use of the tools themselves and does not entail the\\nnecessary pedagogical skills that will allow them to teach the tools in powerful\\npedagogical ways (ACM K–12 Task Force Curriculum Committee). The TPCK\\nframework can delineate the knowledge that informatics teachers need to develop\\nTECHNOLOGY MAPPING\\n/\\n219\\nin order to teach computer applications in optimal ways, and the TM guidelines\\ncan facilitate their instructional design efforts in terms of teaching computer\\napplications meaningfully and not in fragmented and compartmentalized ways.\\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\\nIn conclusion, the study has theoretical significance related to the enactment of\\nthe TM approach, and consequently the development of TPCK as a unique body of\\nknowledge. Furthermore, it provides empirical data about the effectiveness of\\nTM, and thus it contributes to the ongoing discussions about how TPCK can be\\ndeveloped. Additionally, the study has practical significance as it provides step-\\nby-step instructional design guidelines about how teacher educators can teach\\nExcel, as well as how to teach with Excel. Undoubtedly, it would be beneficial and\\nvaluable if more and more educational researchers made use of the TM method-\\nology in order to develop coherent theories of how TPCK development should be\\napproached. The findings of this study can be used as baseline data for comparison\\npurposes in future studies that may be conducted to further validate or modify TM.\\nREFERENCES\\nAbbitt, J. (2011).
